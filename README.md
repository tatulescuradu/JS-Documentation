# JS Documentation Page

This project is a simple and responsive JavaScript documentation page inspired by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). The page is designed to provide basic JavaScript documentation, including topics such as variables, data types, functions, and more.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The page is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, including mobile devices.
- **Fixed Navigation Bar:** A fixed navigation bar on the left side of the page allows users to quickly navigate through different sections of the documentation.
- **Code Blocks:** Code examples are provided in a formatted and readable manner.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Provides the structure of the page.
- **CSS3:** Used for styling and layout, including responsiveness.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the documentation page.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles used to style the page and make it responsive.

## Usage

To view the documentation page, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### HTML Overview

The HTML file is structured with a navigation bar (`<nav>`) containing links to different sections of the documentation. The main content is enclosed in `<main>` with multiple sections, each representing a different topic in JavaScript.

### CSS Overview

The CSS file includes styling for the overall page, navigation bar, and responsive design. Media queries are used to adjust the layout for smaller screen sizes.

### Example Sections

Here are a few examples of the sections covered in the documentation:

- **Introduction:** Provides a brief overview of JavaScript.
- **Variables:** Explains how to declare and use variables in JavaScript.
- **Data Types:** Describes the different data types available in JavaScript.
- **Functions:** Covers the basics of function declarations and usage.

## Responsive Design

The page layout adjusts for smaller screens:

- On screens smaller than 815px, the navigation bar becomes a horizontal bar at the top of the page.
- On screens smaller than 400px, additional adjustments are made to ensure content is accessible and readable.
